	* do_test (): Allows to save/load initial configuration files.

2014-01-19 David Abbasi (abbasi.david_at_gmail.com)
	* param.f90: Keyword 'allow_high_coverage' added
	* is_occupied function: Checks if is occupied depending on the
	allow_high_coverage value.
	* occupied.f90 : Added check_inter_linker function to fine tune energy
	barriers between cis and trans isomerizations in a linker.

	* README : Updated
	* code: General code commented

2013-06-26 David Abbasi (abbasi.david_at_gmail.com)

	* random.f90 : Added init_random_seed function
	* param.f90: Seed for random number generation is created at the runtime
	             using the system clock.
				 · Keyword "Multicolor" lets draw the different isomers in
				 different colors
				 · Keyword "show_proportions" to see the proportions of the
				 differents isomers
	* objetcs.f90 : draw_proportions function created
	* draw.f90 :  sums all the different isomers for computing the proportions

	isomerization movements
	* objects.f90 : Draws the molecules smaller
	* all_moves.f90 : Added isomerization
	* interactions.f90 : Added arrays for the isomerization movement
	* make_move.f90 : Included the isomerization
	* param.f90: Edited to read new barriers

Version 1.0.2

	* is_occupied() function: Simplified. Only checks if the grid point "i"
	is occupied or not. This allows a side by side configuration. Problem of
	this: Molecules inside a chain can rotate and leave the chain, even when
	the barrier becomes high.  
	* all_moves: Changed the diffusion part acording to allow one molecule per
	each grid point allowing side by side molecules. 

		ALTERNATIVE: Use the all_moves of the version 1.0.1 where the
		molecules uses two grid points, but you have to modify the is_occupied
		function, and check if the movement will yield a parallel configuration,
		in such a case you can allow the movement even when the site is
		occupied by a contiguous molecule.

	* README: Updated

	* interections.f90: New Module created with the interactions Matrix and
	the function interactions, for checking up the interactions with the
	environment and compute the barriers.
